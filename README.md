# About Me :wave: :man_technologist:

I'm a tech enthusiast who has been passionate about cyber security and software development since the mid-90s.

## Projects :rocket:

I primarily use :snake: Python and :earth_americas: web languages to create basic full-stack apps to prototype ideas for my day job.

## Experience Highlights :trophy:

* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript (jQuery, DataTables, Bootstrap)
* Python (Flask, FastAPI, Scapy, Pandas)

I've completed some C++ and Kotlin courses to help troubleshoot Linux installs and Android apps, but would like to eventually become proficient in those languages as well.

## GitHub Profile :fire:

I've never taken the time to build a pretty Github README for my projects, but for this assignment, I found this [Awesome Github Profile README](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme) repository to reference in the future.
